The source2/ image is overwritten by the merged image.\r\n\r\nInspiration for this function came from a need to create a side-by-side GIF.\r\n- batch-merge-image-pairs.scm should be placed in the ~/.gimp-x.x/scripts/ directory\r\n- source1/ and source2/ contain the same number of images with identical naming convention\r\n- Image sizes and offsets were pre-configured using Gimp's GAP video plugin\r\n- The resulting merged image frames can be saved as an animated GIF (Video->Frames-to-Image...)\r\n- Profit!!\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\ngimp -i -b '(batch-merge-image-pairs \"source1/*.xcf\" \"source2/*.xcf\")' -b '(gimp-quit 0)'\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
